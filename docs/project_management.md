# Project Management — NUVIE

NUVIE is managed using a hybrid project tracking approach:

- **GitHub** → Code, issues, pull requests
- **Notion** → Task planning, phases, sprint tracking, team workload

---

## 📌 Why We Use Notion

- Clear task ownership
- Visual sprint tracking
- Phase-based planning (Phase 1, Phase 2, ...)
- Progress monitoring for advisor reviews

---

## 🗂 Phase 1 (Foundation) Tracking

Phase 1 was fully tracked in Notion with the following sections:

- Deliverables table
- Team-based task assignment
- Progress tracker
- Completion checklist

Each Phase is:
- Planned in Notion
- Implemented in GitHub
- Documented in `docs/`

---

## 🔄 Sync Between GitHub & Notion

- Every major feature in Notion has:
  - A corresponding GitHub Issue
  - A related Pull Request
- Phase completion is validated in both platforms.

---

## ✅ Advisor Visibility

Notion boards can be shared with read-only access for demonstration,
evaluation, and review purposes.
