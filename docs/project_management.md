# Project Management — NUVIE

NUVIE is managed using a hybrid project tracking approach:

- **GitHub** → Code, issues, pull requests
- **Notion** → Task planning, phases, sprint tracking, team workload

---

## 📌 Why We Use Notion

- Clear task ownership
- Visual sprint tracking
- Phase-based planning (Phase 1, Phase 2, ...)
- Progress monitoring for advisor reviews
