# scikit-learn: pinned to a compatible minor range
scikit-learn>=1.2,<2.0

# TensorFlow: pinned safe minor range (pure PyPI install on most platforms)
tensorflow>=2.12,<3.0

# PyTorch: we DO NOT pin a single wheel here because CPU/CUDA and OS
# combos require platform-specific wheels. Install PyTorch using the
# official selector in the README below (example commands are provided there).
