# 🎬 NUVIE — AI Powered Social Movie Recommendation Platform

Nuvie is an AI-powered social movie recommendation platform that combines intelligent
personalization with real social interaction. Unlike traditional recommendation systems
that focus only on individual preferences, Nuvie integrates **friend activity, social feedback,
and machine learning** into one unified discovery experience.

Users can rate, review, and discuss movies with friends while receiving **dynamic,
friend-aware recommendations** powered by a hybrid AI model.

## ✅ How to Run Locally (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nuvie.git
cd nuvie
cp infra/env.example .env
docker-compose up --build
```

Backend will be available at:
http://localhost:8000/docs

AI Service will be available at:
http://localhost:9000/docs

Python dependencies
- Install runtime and test deps for the AI modules and local evaluation with:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The minimal `requirements.txt` includes `pandas`, `numpy` and `pytest` used by data pipelines, models and smoke tests.

Optional ML dependencies
- For model training or larger ML workloads, install optional ML packages:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
```
- `requirements-ml.txt` contains `scikit-learn`; for deep learning, install `torch` or `tensorflow` following their official guides.

PyTorch install notes
- PyTorch wheels depend on your OS and CUDA version. We recommend installing PyTorch with the official selector at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

Examples:

- CPU-only (cross-platform):

```bash
python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

- CUDA 11.8 example (adjust for your CUDA version):

```bash
python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Notes:
- If you have a GPU and need CUDA support, pick the appropriate wheel (the selector on the PyTorch site helps).
- TensorFlow is included in `requirements-ml.txt` pinned to a safe minor range; install with the same `pip` command above.
